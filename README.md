<h1>Introduction</h1>

The Multisensor Matchup System is a set of software components that allows to detect
simultaneous measurements of geolocated instrument data. Its main purpose is to support
the validation of satellite based instruments by generating cross-sensor matches of either
instruments from different platforms or between satellite and ground-based measurements.
