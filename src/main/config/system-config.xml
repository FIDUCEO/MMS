        Allows to specify custom archiving rules for sensors. Several rule tags are allowd. The path elements
        recognized during processing are
        - SENSOR - the sensor name
        - VERSION - the version string
        - YEAR - the year
        - MONTH - the month
        - DAY - the day.
        - DAY_OF_YEAR - the day of year
        These will be expanded during processing to their actual values. All other pathe elements are treated as
        constant values. The separator character is always the forward slash "/"
