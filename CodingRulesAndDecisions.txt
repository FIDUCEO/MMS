      The purpose of this document is to contain implementation decisions which was made in
      the past, so that any developer can read this document and should be able to implement
      compatible code.

General stuff
-------------
- only check code to Github when the tests run green. The procedure should always be
  - git pull github master
  - mvn clean install
  - git push github master (only if all tests have run successfully)

- crosscheck after a push that also the buildserver executes correctly: http://buildserver:8111/

- when adding a feature or changing software configuration - document it!
  - add all tasks done for the current version to CHANGES.md
  - document it in the manual (fs1:/projects/ongoing/CCI+SST/MMS)


Reader implementation
---------------------
    Any implemented reader should return variables and attributes as close as possible to the original.

    For example:
      o It is mandatory, that any variable with a number data type must have a fill value attribute
        with the CF conform attribute name "_FillValue".
          o If the original variable don't have such an attribute assigned, a new one must be
            added to the variable.
          o If the original variable already have an fill value assigned, but with a NOT CF conform
            name, the attribute must be duplicated and the CF conform name must be set.

    A reader is identified by a signature string, the so-called sensor key. A reader can support multiple sensor keys
    (e.g. AVHRR from different platforms). A sensor key must always be composed like:
       <SENSOR>-<PLATFORM>-<OTHER_STUFF>
    where
    - SENSOR: the sensor short name, e.g. olci
    - PLATFORM: a platform abbreviation, e.g. s3b
    - OTHER_STUFF: any additional information required to distinguish the reader from others in the system.
    Example: hirs-n10-fcdr
